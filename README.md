# Resume Classification Project  

## Overview  
The Resume Classification Project automates resume screening using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Machine Learning**, reducing manual HR effort. It extracts and processes text from resumes in **.pdf, .doc, and .docx** formats, applies **TF-IDF vectorization** and **label encoding**, and classifies resumes into predefined job roles using a **Decision Tree Classifier**. The project is deployed via **Streamlit** for easy accessibility.  

## Features  
- **Resume Parsing** – Extracts text from **.pdf, .doc, and .docx** files.  
- **Data Preprocessing** – Applies **TF-IDF vectorization** and **label encoding** for feature extraction.  
- **Resume Classification** – Categorizes resumes into specific job roles:  
  - **Peoplesoft**  
  - **React.js Developer**  
  - **SQL Developer Insight**  
  - **Workday**  
- **Deployment** – Provides a user-friendly **Streamlit** interface for HR professionals.  

## Technology Stack  
- **Programming Language**: Python  
- **Libraries & Tools**: pandas, scikit-learn, nltk, pdfminer, docx  
- **Machine Learning Model**: Random Forest Classifier  
- **Deployment Framework**: Streamlit  

## How It Works  
1. **Upload** a resume in **.pdf or .docx** format.  
2. The system **extracts and processes text** for relevant features.  
3. The **trained model** predicts the job category based on extracted information.  
4. The results are displayed in an **intuitive Streamlit dashboard**.  

## Project Impact  
This project significantly **enhances HR efficiency** by reducing manual effort in resume screening. It enables **fast, automated classification** of resumes into relevant job roles, improving the **recruitment process**.
